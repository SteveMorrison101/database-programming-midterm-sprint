A table is in 3NF if the following two criteria are met;
    1. The table is already in 2NF
    2. It has no trasitive dependencies (non-key columns only depend on the primary key)

Speakers Table:
    1. 1NF is satisfied because each column only contains atomic values
    2. 2NF is satisfied because 1NF is satified and the primary key (id) uniquely identifies each speaker, and all of the non-key attributes 
    (name, email, topic) depend entirely on id.
    3. 3NF is satified because 2NF is satisfied and no transitive dependencies exist because every column directly relates to the id and doesn't 
    depend on any non-key column.
    
Attendees Table:
    1. 1NF is satisfied because each column only contains atomic values
    2. 2NF is satisfied because 1NF is satified and the primary key (id) uniquely identifies each attendee and no partial dependencies exist
    3. 3NF is satified because 2NF is satisfied and there are no transitive dependencies, the organization column only depends on the primary key id 

Sessions Table
    1. 1NF is satisfied because each column only contains atomic values
    2. 2NF is satisfied because 1NF is satified and the primary key (id) uniquely identifies each session and no speaker_id refers to the speakers 
    table through a forign key, ensuring no partial dependencies exist
    3. 3NF is satified because 2NF is satisfied and there are no transitive dependencies, speaker_id/id from speakers is a foreign key reference
    
    
Registrations Table
    1. 1NF is satisfied because each column only contains atomic values
    2. 2NF is satisfied because 1NF is satified and the primary key (attendee_id and session_id) defines each registration and no partial dependencies exist    
    3. 3NF is satified because 2NF is satisfied and no transitive dependencies exist because both columns in the table are foreign keys that 
    depend primary keys (id from attendees and id from sessions).
